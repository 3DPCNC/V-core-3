# DXF File Notice

We are aware of the issue where the unit mark of the DXF files are wrongly set in inches. All files where exported with millimeters. Depending on the resolution of the issue in the CAD software we will figure out a solution - till then set your file unit to millimeters when importing.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
