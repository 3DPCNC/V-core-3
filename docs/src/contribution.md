V-Core 3 users (including a couple of prominent youtubers in the 3D printing space) have been customizing their machines and designing some really cool accessories, jigs and upgrades in the process!

Some ideas have drawn considerable attention and interest, and we're very fortunate as a community that their creators are openly sharing their designs, for everyone to use. In the true spirit of the open-source movement, the hive mind has already taken hold of the project and started the never-ending process of continuous improvement - nothing could make us more excited than witnessing this!

Below we offer a tutorial for users to submit their contributions so they can be reviewed by our team and added directly to the main V-Core 3 Repository, on GitHub.

We invite all existing and future contributors to use this process, so we can have everything in the same place, for everyone's benefit!

Thank you to all contributors for inspiring the community! We're excited to see what everyone else will come up with!

What about you? Do you have any special plans for your machine? ðŸ™‚
